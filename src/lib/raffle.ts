/**
 * Giveaway fairness — the math that makes "provably fair" a checkable
 * claim instead of a vibe. Server-side only (node:crypto).
 *
 * The protocol:
 *   1. CREATE  — server generates secret S, publishes commit = sha256(S)
 *                as a hash-chained engine write. The commitment exists
 *                before the first entry, timestamped by seq.
 *   2. ENTER   — confirmed entries append to raffle_entries; each gets
 *                a random public ticket id. PII never leaves the server;
 *                tickets are the public face.
 *   3. CLOSE   — entries stop at closesAt (validated, not flipped).
 *   4. DRAW    — seed = sha256(S ‖ beacon ‖ merkle(sorted tickets)).
 *                The beacon is an ITC block hash from AFTER close —
 *                public randomness nobody (including us) controlled at
 *                commit time. Winners by rejection sampling: no modulo
 *                bias, however many tickets there are.
 *   5. VERIFY  — S is revealed; anyone recomputes every step by hand.
 *
 * Every function here is deterministic and pure so the verify page,
 * the draw endpoint, and the tests can never disagree.
