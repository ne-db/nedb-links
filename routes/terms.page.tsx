            <b className="text-fg">Free, forever:</b> one profile with your handle, a full page of
            blocks, every theme, a print-grade QR code, save-my-contact, and live stats. A complete
            thing — not a crippled demo.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b className="text-fg">Premium, pay once:</b> whatever it's worth to you (there's a
            small floor), one time, never monthly. It adds more profiles, unlimited blocks, photo
            galleries, the QR studio, custom search &amp; sharing, giveaways, a listing in
            Discover, and the font vault. Anyone who bought Premium before the current profile
            allowance existed keeps the deal they bought — we don't rewrite paid promises.

        <Section title="Handles are licenses, not property">
          <p>
            Claiming a handle gives you a license to use it here — it doesn't make it yours the way
            your name is yours. We keep the namespace honest for real people, which means we can
            reclaim a handle when it's being abused:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 grid gap-1.5">
            <li>
              <b className="text-fg">Impersonation or trademark abuse</b> — pretending to be someone
              you're not, or camping a brand you have no claim to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="text-fg">Squatting at scale</b> — parking, hoarding, or reselling
              handles rather than using them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b className="text-fg">Long-dead pages</b> — unpublished and untouched for a year or
              more (we'll try to reach you first where we can).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Payments unlock features; they don't buy immunity from any of this. If you believe a
            handle is impersonating you or infringing your mark, contact us and we'll look at it
            like humans.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Your content">
          <p>
            Your pages are yours. Don't publish anything illegal, deceptive, or designed to harm
            people, and don't use giveaways to mislead entrants — the draw mechanics are public and
            verifiable by design, and we keep them that way.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Changes">
          <p>
            When these terms change, the change is dated and the meaningful ones get called out —
            and anything you already paid for keeps working the way it was sold to you.
